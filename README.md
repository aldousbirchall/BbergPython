# BbergPython
Data Tools for Bloomberg. Needs a local Bloomberg desktop installation to run.

Various market data type queries with data maniplution to run in Strata Tool. All code here uses the excellent Tia module which is a bloomberg V3 API wrapper. https://github.com/bpsmith/tia

Part of a project to build / protoype a complete open source front office risk system using: Open Gamma Strata (derivatives analytics), Python (Data, non-derivates analytics), MS SQL Server Express (database). Could use MySQL / PostgreSQL (truly open source) but for non-massive financial data sets in .NET framework, this is easier and more robust - at least on the scale of me building the whole thing myself). Excel (essentially a GUI. Could go down the JavaScript / HTML route, but traders like to cut and past from excel). Powershell (just trying this out, but seems to be very powerful and forgiving to new users). Backwards compatible with CMD shell.
